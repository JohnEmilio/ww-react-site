# My Awesome Project
Workout Wingman was designed to help you keep better track of your daily workout and the exercises you like. With a database of over 1300 exercises to choose from, Workout Wingman has you covered!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, RestAPI, HTML, CSS

Originally started out the project using vanilla JavaScript, but after some trial and error, decided that React would be best use for this app. React and it's libraries are used to route and render all the pages. Using React's hooks (useEffect and useState), I was able to interact with a RestAPI to get exercise data which the user can filter as desired while controlling side effects and storing valuable data in state. 

## Optimizations
1. Looking to implement a Node backend in the future.
2. User Auth for login
3. Expanding database for users to add more information about their exercises (sets, reps, any pertinent info)

## Lessons Learned:

Sometimes it is best to sit back and re-evaluate the original plan to see how things can be done better, even if that involves scraping and redoing part of the project. At the same time, it can be used as a learning experiment to see how you might be able to integrate new tech into your projects.
